Unfashionably late

It is the first day of the academic year at the Karrakin Cavalry College, and a handful of kuirassers (soon-to-be kevalliers) are late to the Matriculation Ball. Each of them had their own reason to be late for the occasion, but they were all unfashionably late regardless. As they step from the groundcars that swept them across Throne Karrakis and into the grounds of the College, they find themselves dwarfed by the monumental entrance of the **Lykeon**, the grand college's building of administration, instruction, and academic work.

As guards and white gloves usher them inside, each of the students are scanned and announced on arrival. The late students are:

- **Primor Argus III, Cavaleiro do Roz, Son of the Thorn.** A promising engineer from __House of Glass__ with rumors sprung around his family's name.
- **Nemesis Tharsonis.** A historian from __House of Remembrance__ that wishes to expand her own knowledge beyond her house.
- **Cybren Solaris.** A prodigious son of the Solaris family of __House of Moments__, one of the younger students of the College.
- **Tomoe Shiratsuki, Herald of the Shiratsuki Dynasty.** An ignoble, yet extremely capable astral navigator, daughter of one of the main shareholders of the __Smith-Shimano Corporation__.
- **Valtameri Laut**, a doctor from the smaller House Laut from the __House of Water__.

The hubbub of conversation dims briefly in deference, until returning to a hundred different conversations backed by the refined strains of a chamber orchestra. The ballroom is a riot of color and sparkling light; students and faculty mingle and dance in a mixture of military uniforms and elaborate formalwear in a panoply of styles and fashions from across the Concern. Seeing how people were already talking, dancing, and socializing, it was clear that the late students were so late that they missed all of the commencement speeches.

They only had a few moments to compose themselves and make any formal introductions to each other before they spot an older woman through the crowd whose steely eyes fixed on them with an unamused glare. She is dressed in an immaculate gown in rich purple with floating sleeves, approaching them in a mechanical legged chair accompanied by functionaries wearing the more austere dress uniform of the college staff. It was **Archchancellor Baroness Sigune Zoeva of House Calyx of the House of Order**, head of the College.

While each student gave their own excuses or reasons to be late, the Baroness wasn't particularly thrilled that students would disappoint her *before* even meeting her. Nonetheless, she welcomes them all the same and advises the students to meet their tutors. Not far away, three key members of faculty could be spotted talking with each other. They were **Stablemaster Imani Rudis**, head of the *Technical* Syllabus; **Underbaron Iphianassa Akrita di Khayradi**, head of the *Tactical* Syllabus, and finally **Lord Castor-Eyros**, head of the *Noble Arts* Syllabus.

The interactions with the heads of syllabus were almost a perfect split of a pair per instructor:
- Captain Leman and Kasha could immediately recognize Underbaron Iphianassa and her rank, immediately saluting and presenting themselves and their rank immediately after the tutor ordered. Her words were... less comforting than the others'. Explaining how they shall "**lay down her lives for the children of Karrakis.**"
- Yarrin and Quinn felt Stablemaster Imani strike a chord with them because of his lacking social skills, much like them too. However, he quickly gives them a complex technical problem to test them. While Yarrin had a near immediate and accurate answer, Quinn was too shy to speak up. Imani was quick to encourage Quinn to speak up, even if wrong. Inviting them to "**not shy away from making mistakes, for they can learn from them**".
- And lastly, Lord Castor had a poetic and philosophical conversation with Lady Camille and her bodyguard after they asked if he was just a literature teacher. Debating on the active use of politics, how 'even puppets can dance without their strings', and how "***a status quo isn't defined or broken by change, but by progress***".

Both the Stablemaster and the Underbaron didn't seem to strike much interest into the new students. Only Imani seemed to take an eye on Valtameri, but the two tutors had more pressing matters after Lord Castor presented them both. Leaving shortly after giving proper welcomes. 

*`Later...`*

As the Ball had slowly died down and other students found themselves talking more than dancing, or leaving early to rest, the late students each found themselves exploring the luscious gardens surrounding the Lykeon. Particularly Quinn crashed with Leman in a corner, and CALIGRAND and Camille finding Yarrin calmly on his pad. The cool night, the beautiful gardens, and calmer conversations served as distraction and respite... until the sound of groans and laughter were faintly heard in the distance. Exploring and investigating the sounds, the late students find a *plainly dressed figure*, half-curled in a protective ball, being repeatedly and viciously kicked in the gut and head by a tall, *muscular woman in an ornate uniform*, bearing the colors of **House of Stone.** A handful of students have gathered, and there is laughter at each successfully delivered kick. The victim cried for help as the tall woman continued to kick and yell at the victim for being an '**Ungrateful-sympathizing piece of shit**'. 

Valtameri was the first to see what was happening and couldn't look away from a wounded person. The students stopped laughing noting that there was a new bystander, and the tall woman fiercely stood her ground telling Valtameri to get lost. Then, the others kuirassers arrived.

Tomoe snuck and quickly moved to be at the bullied student's side, even after one of the students drew a sword on her. He too wore an ornate uniform, but bared the colors of House of Sand. At the escalation of violence Nemesis and Argus continued to help Valtameri with de-escalating the situation, all the while Solaris stayed back and attempted to fry electronics of the bullies. Nemesis brought up the standard procedures of duels and how they were used to deal with disputes such as these. Argus even took it a step further and challenged them to one, giving the aggressors an idea.

With a wicked smile in their face and their victim protected, the aggressors leave and the rest of the bystander students leave. The late students properly meet the very hurt **Rawan Azar**, a kuirasser from **House of Promise**. A polarizing house and a polarizing lady who could only explain that she advocated for the 'Free Sanjak' cause. She was too tired and hurt to explain herself any further, so the new students brought her to the infirmary.

After a night of planning, gathering information, and sharing with each other, the kuirassers prepared for whatever may come in the following days regarding the duel and the implications of their intervention... 

The next day, however, each of the new students receive a challenge to a formal duel under the College’s regulations for mechanized combat. The appellants’ names are listed as “**Lord Praya-Cannamos, the Ironhanded, First Daughter and Graven Heir of Stonelord Hyderad Cannamos**”, and “**Count Argo, the Wolf’s Blade, of the House Laurent of the House of Sand, storied son of Tilimsan**” with the reason being... “*a point of honor*”.
